Anywhere you have repeated chunks of code, apply some DRY principles. Generally, once some chunk of code is appearing for a 3rd time or so, that's when you want to consider refactoring.

Confirm that your code is following the single responsibility rule. Each function should only do one thing, with the capability to break it out further as needed.
